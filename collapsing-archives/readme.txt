This plugin uses Javascript to dynamically expand or collapse the set of months for each year and posts for each month in the archive listing of your blog..

== Description ==

Create collapsible archives by year or month. Features include: link to archive pages, display of individual posts and support for custom post-types. 

== Installation ==

= WIDGET INSTALLATION =

The easiest way to use this plugin is as a widget. 

After you have installed the Collapsing Archives plugin,  then simply go the Appearance > Widgets section in wp-admin and add the Collapsing Archives Widget to whatever sidebar or widget section you like, and then configure to your heart's content.

= MANUAL INSTALLATION =

It is also possible to use the plugin on any page you like with a little bit of PHP code.  Simply change the following here appropriate (most likely sidebar.php):

Change From:

    <ul>
     `<?php wp_get_archives(); ?>`
    </ul>

To something of the following:
`
    <?php
     if( function_exists('collapsArch') ) {
      collapsArch();
     } else {
      echo "<ul>\n";
      wp_get_archives();
      echo "</ul>\n";
     }
    ?>
`

    * If using manually with more than one instance on a page, you can give
      unique ids to each instance with this option. For example, if you had
      one instance with number 1 and another with number 2, the ul for March
      2004 for number 1 would have an id of 'collapsArch-2004-3:1', while the
      id for number 2 would be 'collapsArch-2004-3:2'
* debug
    * When set to true, extra debugging information will be displayed in the

      this option if you are having problems

= Examples =

`collapsArch('accordion=1&sort=ASC&expand=3&inExcludeCat=exclude&inExcludeCats=general,uncategorized')`
This will produce a list with:
* accordion style expanding and collapsing
* shown in chronological order
* using images to mark collapsing and expanding
* exclude posts from  the categories general and uncategorized

`collapsArch('post_type=recipe')`
This will produce a list with:
* only posts of type 'recipe'
* shown in chronological order
* using images to mark collapsing and expanding
* exclude posts from  the categories general and uncategorized

= CAVEAT =

This plugin relies on Javascript, but does degrade
gracefully if it is not present/enabled to show all of the
archive links as usual.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=  How do I change the style of the collapsing archives lists? =

  The collapsing archives plugin uses several ids and classes which can be
styled with CSS. These can be changed from the settings page. You may have to
rename some of the id statements. For example, if your sidebar is called
"myawesomesidebar", you would rewrite the line 

  #sidebar li.collapsArch {list-style-type:none}
  to
  #myawesomesidebar li.collapsArch {list-style-type:none}

If you are using the plugin manually (i.e. inserting code into your theme),
you may want to replace #sidebar with #collapsArchList

= There seems to be a newline between the collapsing/expanding symbol and the
category name. How do I fix this? =

If your theme has some css that says something like

#sidebar li a {display:block}

that is the problem. 
You probably want to add a float:left to the .sym class
